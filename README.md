# Random Forest Algorithm for Machine Learning

## Description

This repository contains an implementation of the Random Forest Algorithm, a popular ensemble learning method for classification and regression tasks in machine learning. Random Forest is based on constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode (for classification) or mean (for regression) of the individual trees as the final prediction.
